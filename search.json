When there is flexibility in when an application needs to run.\nB. When there are mission-critical workloads.\nC. When dedicated capacity is needed.\nD. When an instance should not be stopped.\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation:\n\nThe key to understanding spot instances is to look at the way that cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) operate.\nCloud service providers invest in hardware resources and then release those resources (often on a per-hour basis) to subscribers.\nOne of the problems with this business model, however, is that at any given time, there are likely to be compute resources that are not being utilized.\nThese resources represent hardware capacity that AWS has paid for but are sitting idle, and not making AWS any money at the moment.\nRather than allowing these computing resources to go to waste, AWS offers them at a substantially discounted rate, with the understanding that if someone needs those resources for running a normal EC2 instance, that instance will take priority over spot instances that are using the hardware resources at a discounted rate.\nIn fact, spot instances will be stopped if the resources are needed elsewhere.\n\nReference: https://awsinsider.net/articles/2017/09/25/aws-spot-instances-primer.aspx\n\nA company is considering moving its on-premises data center to AWS. What factors should be included in doing a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis? (Choose two.)\n\nA. Amazon EC2 instance availability\nB. Power consumption of the data center\nC.

Users bid on the maximum price they are willing to pay per hour.\nB. Users choose a 1-, 3- or 5-year upfront payment term.\nC. Users pay for the required permanent storage on a file system or in a database.\nD. Users pay based on the number of requests and consumed compute resources.\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCorrect Answer: D\nExplanation:\n\nAWS Lambda is charging its users by the number of requests for their functions and by the duration, which is the time the code needs to execute.\nWhen code starts running in response to an event, AWS Lambda counts a request.\nIt will charge the total number of requests across all of the functions used.\nDuration is calculated by the time when your code started executing until it returns or until it is terminated, rounded up near to 100ms.\nThe AWS Lambda pricing depends on the amount of memory that the user used to allocate to the function.\n\nReference: https://dashbird.io/blog/aws-lambda-pricing-model-explained/\n\nWhat function do security groups serve related Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance security?\n\nA. Act as a virtual firewall for the Amazon EC2 instance.\nB. Secure AWS user accounts with AWS identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.\nC. Provide DDoS protection with AWS Shield.\nD. Use Amazon CloudFront to protect the Amazon EC2 instance.\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCorrect Answer: A\nExplanation:\n\nAWS Security Groups act like a firewall for your Amazon EC2 instances controlling both inbound and outbound traffic.\nWhen you launch an instance on Amazon EC2, you need to assign it to a particular security group.\nAfter that, you can set up ports and protocols, which remain open for users and computers over the internet.\nAWS Security Groups are very flexible. You can use the default security group and still customize it according to your liking (although we don’t recommend this practice because groups should be named according to their purpose.) Or you can create a security group that you want for your specific applications.\nTo do this, you can write the corresponding code or use the Amazon EC2 console to make the process easier.\n\nReference: https://www.threatstack.com/blog/aws-security-groups-what-they-are-and-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-them\n\nWhich disaster recovery scenario offers the lowest probability of down time?\n\nA. Backup and restore\nB. Pilot light\nC. Warm standby\nD. Multi-site active-active\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCorrect Answer: D\nExplanation:\n\nBackup and Restore: a simple, straightforward, cost-effective method that backs up and restores data as needed.\nKeep in mind that because none of your data is on standby, this method, while cheap, can be quite time-consuming.\nPilot Light: This method keeps critical applications and data at the ready so that it can be quickly retrieved if needed.\nWarm Standby: This method keeps a duplicate version of your business’ core elements running on standby at all times, which makes for a little downtime and an almost seamless transition.\nMulti-Site Solution: Also known as a Hot Standby, this method fully replicates your company’s data/ applications between two or more active locations and splits your traffic/usage between them.\nIf a disaster strikes, everything is simply rerouted to the unaffected area, which means you’ll suffer almost zero downtime.\nHowever, by running two separate environments simultaneously, you will obviously incur much higher costs.\n\nReference: https://cloudranger.com/best-practices-aws-disaster-recovery-planning/"

Implement loose coupling.\nC. Implement monolithic design.\nD. Implement vertical scaling.\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation:\n\nLoose coupling between services can also be done through asynchronous integration. It involves one component that generates events and another that consumes them.\nThe two components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction, but usually through an intermediate durable storage layer.\nThis approach decouples the two components and introduces additional resiliency.\nSo, for example, if a process that is reading messages from the queue fails, messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.\n\nReference: https://www.botmetric.com/blog/aws-cloud-architecture-design-principles/\n\nWhich of the following security measures protect access to an AWS account? (Select TWO.)\n\nA. Enable AWS CloudTrail.\nB. Grant least privilege access to IAM users.\nC. Create one IAM user and share with many developers and users.\nD. Enable Amazon CloudFront.\nE. Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged users.\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCorrect Answer: BE\nExplanation:\n\nIf you decided to create service accounts (that is, accounts used for programmatic access by applications running outside of the AWS environment) and generate access keys for them, you should create a dedicated service account for each use case.\nThis will allow you to restrict the associated policy to only the permissions needed for the particular use case, limiting the blast radius if the credentials are compromised.\nFor example, if a monitoring tool and a release management tool both require access to your AWS environment, create two separate service accounts with two separate policies that define the minimum set of permissions for each tool.\n\nReference: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/guidelines-for-protecting-your-aws-account-while-using-programmatic-access/\n\nWhich service provides a hybrid storage service that enables on-premises applications to seamlessly use cloud storage?\n\nA.

AWS Directory Service\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation:\n\nThe AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual, and regulatory compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated Hardware Security Module (HSM) instances within the AWS cloud.\nAWS and AWS Marketplace partners offer a variety of solutions for protecting sensitive data within the AWS platform, but for some applications and data subject to contractual or regulatory mandates for managing cryptographic keys, additional protection may be necessary.\nCloudHSM complements existing data protection solutions and allows you to protect your encryption keys within HSMs that are designed and validated to government standards for secure key management.\nCloudHSM allows you to securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys used for data encryption in a way that keys are accessible only by you.\n\nReference: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/faqs/\n\nUnder the AWS shared responsibility model, the customer manages which of the following? (Choose two.)\n\nA. Decommissioning of physical storage devices\nB. Security group and ACL configuration\nC. Patch management of an Amazon RDS instance operating system\nD. Controlling physical access to data centers\nE. Patch management of an Amazon EC2 instance operating system\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCorrect Answer: BE\nExplanation: https://www.whizlabs.com/blog/aws-security-shared-responsibility/\n\nWhich AWS service is suitable for an event-driven workload?\n\nA. Amazon EC2\nB. AWS Elastic Beanstalk\nC. AWS Lambda\nD. Amazon Lumberyard\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation:\n\nAn easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and web services developed in a number of programming languages.\nYou can configure event notifications for your Elastic Beanstalk environment so that notable events can be automatically published to an SNS topic, then pushed to topic subscribers.\nAs an example, you may use this event-driven architecture to coordinate your continuous integration pipeline (such as Jenkins CI).\nThat way, whenever an environment is created, Elastic Beanstalk publishes this event to an SNS topic, which triggers a subscribing Lambda function, which then kicks off a CI job against your newly created Elastic Beanstalk environment.\n\nReference: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/event-driven-computing-with-amazon-sns-compute-storage-database-and-networking-services/\n\nWhat is a value proposition of the AWS Cloud?\n\nA. AWS is responsible for security in the AWS Cloud\nB. No long-term contract is required\nC. Provision new servers in days\nD. AWS manages user applications in the AWS Cloud\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCorrect Answer: B\nExplanation: https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-whitepaper-business-value-of-aws.pdf\n\nWhat is a characteristic of Amazon S3 cross-region replication?\n\nA. Both source and destination S3 buckets must have versioning disabled\nB. The source and destination S3 buckets cannot be in different AWS Regions\nC. S3 buckets configured for cross-region replication can be owned by a single AWS account or by different accounts\nD. The source S3 bucket owner must have the source and destination AWS Regions disabled for their account\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCorrect Answer: C\nExplanation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html\n\nWhat is a user responsible for when running an application in the AWS Cloud? - A. Managing physical hardware\n\nB. Updating the underlying hypervisor\nC. Providing a list of users approved for data center access\nD.
